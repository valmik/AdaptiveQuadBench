# AdaptiveQuadBench

AdaptiveQuadBench is a standarized testbed for adaptive quadrotor controllers, built on top of the RotorPy simulator. It provides implementations of various adaptive control strategies and tools to evaluate their performance under different disturbances and conditions.

## Features

- Multiple adaptive controller implementations (Geometric, L1, MPC, INDI, etc.)
- Standardized evaluation framework for controller comparison
- Support for various disturbances (wind, force, torque, parameter uncertainty)
- Parallel simulation capabilities for efficient benchmarking
- Visualization tools for performance analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Conda package manager
- Git

### Optional Dependencies

- [acados python interface](https://docs.acados.org/python_interface/index.html#installation) (required for MPC controllers)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dz298/AdaptiveQuadBench.git
   cd AdaptiveQuadBench
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Create and activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate quadbench
   ```

3. If you plan to use MPC controllers, install acados following the instructions at the [official documentation](https://docs.acados.org/python_interface/index.html#installation).

## Usage

### Running Experiments

To run a basic experiment comparing different controllers:

```bash
python run_eval.py --controller geo geo-a l1geo --experiment wind --num_trials 100
```

Available options:
- `--controller`: Controller types to evaluate (geo, geo-a, l1geo, l1mpc, indi-a, xadap, mpc, all)
- `--experiment`: Experiment type (wind, uncertainty, force, torque, rotoreff)
- `--num_trials`: Number of trials to run
- `--trajectory`: Trajectory type (random, hover, circle)
- `--save_trials`: Save individual trial data
- `--serial`: Run in serial mode (default is parallel)
- `--vis`: Visualize a single trial without saving data

### Finding Controller Limits

To find the failure point of controllers by gradually increasing disturbance intensity:

```bash
python run_eval.py --controller geo geo-a --experiment wind --when2fail --max_intensity 10.0
```

### Finding Delay Margin

To evaluate the robustness of controllers to time delays, you can run the delay margin analysis:

```bash
python run_eval.py --controller geo geo-a l1geo --delay_margin
```

### Visualizing Results

Results are saved in the `data` directory and can be visualized using the included visualization tools.
